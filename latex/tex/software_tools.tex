The ATLAS open data consist in a set of MC and real events that the ATLAS collaboration has released for open use. The main web page where they are introduced is \url{http://atlas.cern/resources/opendata}. Please spend some time on this page, explore it, play with it.

The next step is to actually do something. In the ``Online Open Data Analysis'' section of the page, click on ``Analyse ATLAS Open Data with Jupyter Notebooks'', and then in the jupyter-looking window select ``13-TeV-examples'', then "uproot\_python". You should get to this \href{https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/jupyter/user/atlas-outreach--ection-opendata-hbw4boy5/notebooks/13-TeV-examples/uproot_python}{page}. 

Each notebook corresponds to a different analysis. Please open \verb|HZZAnalysis.ipynb|.
