The main aim of the experience connected with this handbook is to get a glimpse of frontier particle physics. You will be \textit{seeing} the basic bricks with which our universe is composed. You will be observing $Higgs$ bosons, and top quarks and $W$ and $Z$ bosons. These particles form the foundations of our understanding of the electroweak interaction, mass, and stability of our universe. You will be asked to verify some of the properties of these particles, and hopefully by the end fo the experience you will have a better understanding of the work that collider physicists do. 

This is what you are expected to do and prepare: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Preparation:}} You should address all exercises labelled as Ex 1...N in sections 3-5. The answers should mostly be available in this same handbook, but they require some thinking and elaboration on your side. you may need to look for other resources on the web and at the library to answer some of the most complex ones. 
\item{\textbf{Experiments:}} You should run the experiments in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}, document what you have done in a logbook (maybe electronic), and answer all questions as quantitatively as possible. The three experiments are in increasing difficulty. 
\end{itemize}
